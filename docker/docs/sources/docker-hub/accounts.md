# Accounts on Docker Hub

## Docker Hub Accounts

You can `search` for Docker images and `pull` them from [Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com) without signing in or even having an
account. However, in order to `push` images, leave comments or to *star*
a repository, you are going to need a [Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com) account.

### Registration for a Docker Hub Account

You can get a [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) account by
[signing up for one here](https://hub.docker.com/account/signup/). A valid
email address is required to register, which you will need to verify for
account activation.

### Email activation process

You need to have at least one verified email address to be able to use your
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) account. If you can't find the validation email,
you can request another by visiting the [Resend Email Confirmation](
https://hub.docker.com/account/resend-email-confirmation/) page.

### Password reset process

If you can't access your account for some reason, you can reset your password
from the [*Password Reset*](https://hub.docker.com/account/forgot-password/)
page.

## Organizations & Groups

Also available on the Docker Hub are organizations and groups that allow
you to collaborate across your organization or team. You can see what
organizations [you belong to and add new organizations](
https://hub.docker.com/account/organizations/) from the Account
tab.

From within your organizations you can create groups that allow you to
further manage who can interact with your repositories.
