# NAME
docker-logs - Fetch the logs of a container

# SYNOPSIS
**docker logs**
[**-f**|**--follow**[=*false*]]
[**-t**|**--timestamps**[=*false*]]
[**--tail**[=*"all"*]]
CONTAINER

# DESCRIPTION
The **docker logs** command batch-retrieves whatever logs are present for
a container at the time of execution. This does not guarantee execution
order when combined with a docker run (i.e. your run may not have generated
any logs at the time you execute docker logs).

The **docker logs --follow** command combines commands **docker logs** and
**docker attach**. It will first return all logs from the beginning and
then continue streaming new output from the containerâ€™s stdout and stderr.

# OPTIONS

**-t**, **--timestamps**=*true*|*false*
   Show timestamps. The default is *false*.

**--tail**="all"
   Output the specified number of lines at the end of logs (defaults to all logs)
